The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Normally, both your butts would be dead as fried chicken, but you happen
to pull this while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill
you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong
to me. Besides, I've already been through too much this morning over
this case to hand it over to your dumbness.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that.
